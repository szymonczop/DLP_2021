In the first project we will focus on __image classification problem__. 

We will use [Kaggle's fer2013 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data)
which consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces of various emotions which are labeled. It was firstly published during the International Conference on Machine learning.

The task is to categorize each face based on the emotion to one of seven categories.
Labels:

* 0 - Angry
* 1 - Disgust 
* 2 - Fear 
* 3 - Happy
* 4 - Sad
* 5 - Suprise 
* 6 - Neutral
